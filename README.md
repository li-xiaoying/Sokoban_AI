# Sokoban_AI
This project is an AI solver implementation of the puzzle game Sokoban, in which the agent pushes boxes around in a warehouse, trying to get them to storage locations. The goal of the project is using the Q-learning algorithm to train the agent to find a feasible route in which the agent can push all boxes to storage locations.
